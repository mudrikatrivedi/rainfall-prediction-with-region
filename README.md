The climate and different environmental modifications have become a major threat in the agriculture field. This makes the problem of predicting the yielding of crops an exciting challenge. The main aim of this project is to provide a methodology for crop yield production based on the historical climatic and production data. Crop yield prediction based on the previous years of temperature and rainfall can help farmers take necessary steps to improve crop yield in the coming season. In this proposed system, ARMA (Auto Regressive Moving Average) method is used to forecast crop yield. Around past hundred years of data set is taken for temperature and rainfall of the country.
